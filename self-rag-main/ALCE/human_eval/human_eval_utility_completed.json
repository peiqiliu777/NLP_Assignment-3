However, the Football Association of Zambia claimed that Godfrey Chitalu had scored 116 goals (possibly 117) during the 1972 calendar year and 107 during the 1972 season, which could constitute the highest official tally claimed by a national football association. Vartan Ghazarian officially became the highest all-time scorer in the history of Lebanese football after scoring his 130th goal in the Lebanese first division against Tadamon Tyre.",

Three key platforms used for lipid profiling include mass spectrometry, chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is a simpler method of lipid separation. Dittmer's spray reagent for phospholipids is used in thin layer chromatography to detect phospholipids.

After the fall of the Inca Empire many aspects of Inca culture were systematically destroyed, including their sophisticated farming system, known as the vertical archipelago model of agriculture. The Spanish colonial officials used the Inca mita corv\u00e9e labor system for colonial aims, sometimes brutally. The single greatest cause of the decimation of native populations was infectious disease. More died of disease than any army or armed conflict. As the Inca did not have as.",

The shield was created by accident and never duplicated, although efforts to reverse-engineer it resulted in the discovery of adamantium. The shield is painted to become Captain America's symbol. Captain America's shield is virtually indestructible under normal conditions, and while cosmic and magical or godly opponents have broken the shield, the shield proves strong enough to absorb Hulk's strength, and repel an attack from Thor's mystical hammer Mj\u00f6lnir without any visible damage.",

This style of blues was created by musicians bringing blues and gospel influences up from Mississippi and stops along the way and creating a Chicago sound in blues and jazz. Chicago blues was performed in the first blues clubs in Chicago, mostly in predominantly black neighborhoods on the South Side, with a few in the smaller black neighborhoods on the West Side. The standard path for blues musicians was to start out as street musicians and at house parties and eventually make their way to blues clubs.",

Atahualpa seems to have spent more time with Huayna Capac during the years when he was in the north with the army conquering Ecuador. Atahualpa was thus closer to, and had better relations with the army and its leading generals. When both Huayna Capac and his eldest son and designated heir, Ninan Cuyochic, died suddenly in 1528 from what was probably smallpox, a disease introduced by the Spanish into the Americas, the question of who would succeed as emperor was thrown open. The population decline of the Incan empire was caused by infectious diseases brought by the Spanish, leading to a population decline ratio of 58:1 during 1520-1571. The ultimate cause of the downfall of the Incan empire was the Spanish conquest led by Almagro, causing internal conflict among the Incas. Manco Inca tried to take advantage of this to recapture Cusco in 1536, but the Spanish retook it. Manco Inca then retreated to Vilcabamba where he founded the Neo-Inca State and ruled for 36 years. The last Inca stronghold was discovered in 1572, and the last ruler, T\u00fapac Amaru, was captured and executed.",

Three key platforms used for lipid profiling include mass spectrometry, chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is a simpler method of lipid separation. Dittmer's spray reagent for phospholipids is used in thin layer chromatography to detect phospholipids. Automated homogeneous analytical methods are used in clinical laboratories to measure cholesterol in the non-blocked HDL particles.",

The Spanish conquest introduced infectious diseases which the Inca had not acquired immunity to, leading to a population decline ratio of 58:1 during the years of 1520\u20131571. After the fall of the Inca Empire, many aspects of Inca culture were systematically destroyed, including their sophisticated farming system. The indigenous population dramatically collapsed due to exploitation, socioeconomic change and epidemic diseases introduced by the Spanish. Scholars estimate that while the Spanish conquest was undoubtedly the proximate cause of the collapse of the Inca Empire, it may very well have been past its peak and already in the process of decline.",

The shield is virtually indestructible under normal conditions due to its construction of a vibranium and Iron alloy, which absorbs all kinetic energy and transfers very little energy from each impact, preventing Captain America from feeling recoil or transferred impact forces when blocking attacks. The shield was created by accident and never duplicated, although efforts to reverse-engineer it resulted in the discovery of adamantium. The shield is painted to become Captain America's symbol. Captain America's shield is virtually indestructible under normal conditions, and while cosmic and magical or godly opponents have broken the shield, the shield proves strong enough to absorb Hulk's strength, and repel an attack from Thor's mystical hammer Mj\u00f6lnir without any visible damage.",

However, the books do not name any author, as authorship was not considered important by the society that produced them. In the late Second Temple period, the rabbis began to attribute authorship to the books, and Mosaic authorship became the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim tradition. However, the philosopher and theologians such as Thomas Hobbes, Benedict Spinoza, and Richard Simon questioned Mosaic authorship, and Jean Astruc and others concluded that Moses could not have written the preface to Deuteronomy and that the Pentateuchal books were not written by Moses himself.",

When trash is discarded into the ocean, it often becomes incorporated into physical ocean features such as currents and gyres. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, located between Hawaii and California, is an area with an intense concentration of marine trash. Every year, about 8-million tons of plastic ends up in our oceans, which is equal to five bags filled with plastic going along every foot of coastline in the world. While ships throwing trash overboard account for only 20% of the problem, the other 80% comes from land-based activities, as ninety percent of all plastic trash that ends up in the oceans gets there by ten rivers that carry it there.",

Only one in every 1000 mollusks produces pearls, and only 5% of them are natural, which is why natural pearls are valued more. Cultured pearls, which are more common, are formed by implanting an irritant inside the oyster to mimic the natural process. It is important to note that natural pearls are not cultivated, and they are harvested straight from oysters when obtained after fishing. Therefore, the rarity of natural pearls is the reason why it is so rare to find pearls in oysters.",

Exact figures may not be comparable, but you can get a sense of what is out there and make a loose comparison.

His Napoleonic Code is still used today in France, Louisiana, and other parts of the world. Napoleon was driven by his personal ambition for power, which led to his rise and fall. He profoundly changed the history of humanity through his extraordinary military career and his reforms in France. Napoleon's meteoric rise and precipitous fall, as well as his enduring impact on France and the world, is a topic of study in history courses.",

Tinnitus does not cause hearing loss, but it is associated with hearing loss, which often affects quicker vibration sound waves first, resulting in the inability to hear sounds at a higher frequency. The high pitch tone or ringing takes over the hearing for a few seconds and then disappears. It is a misconception that hearing problems only occur.

However, if the ice cream is just reasonably hard, scooping the ice cream will be a little easier with a scoop.",

He was a former Harvard professor who was the High Priest of LSD and ran a campaign for California governor against Ronald Reagan. He was sentenced to ten years in prison for possessing two marijuana cigarettes, but he escaped from prison with the help of the radical Weather Underground, which aimed at sparking a revolution. Nixon was obsessed with tracking down Leary, whom he branded \"the most dangerous man in America\".",

Nevertheless, the TRAPPIST-1 planets may have too much water to support life. The presence of water is often considered as a way to start life, since life on Earth is composed mostly of water and requires it to live.

Some musicians think that nothing is wrong with the music industry. Others think that the music industry is obsessed with youth and is focused on manufacturing boy bands to rise and fall on the charts. However, some musicians believe that the key to success is to do what they love to do and make a living out of it. One should not pretend to know everything about the industry, and it is okay to admit that one does not know it all.",

To account for this discrepancy, airlines opt for a more profitable strategy by overbooking flights. This way, airlines can sell more tickets than they have seats, which is advantageous for them as it is always a loss for the airlines every time a flight takes off with empty seats. If there are more passengers than the available seats, the airline may offer alternative flights with some form of additional compensation in order to entice certain passengers to give up their seat. If no one is willing, the airline is forced to deny boarding to some passengers. It is important to note that airlines are allowed to overbook flights because it is unlikely that all passengers will show up for the flight.",

Additionally, miners try to find a place where electricity is less expensive, as electricity is a significant cost of mining. Crypto mining chips have become more efficient each year, but not to the point that they sufficiently push back against any increased electricity use. While some have expressed concern about the amount of energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining, others argue that the industry is highly flexible in where it can deploy and is still in a developmental stage.

Low fuel prices can help boost economic growth, but two factors behind the oil-price drop - a weaker global economy and a stronger dollar - could hurt the U.S. economy by reducing exports, employment, and spending.

However, the exact science behind how adrenaline increases strength is not well understood. The human body is capable of producing a large amount of adrenaline in response to stress, and this adrenaline can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels, among other things, which can help a person to lift heavy objects that they might not be able to lift under normal circumstances.

Private proxies are perfect for anonymous web browsing and bypassing restrictions on the internet, but they don\u2019t encrypt all the data, so they provide a faster service than a VPN. VPNs, on the other hand, provide a more secure and private connection to the internet. VPNs encrypt all the data, making it impossible for third parties to monitor internet activities.

Voter registration fraud does happen, but it is important to note that voter registration forms are in charge of vetting problem ballots, not the groups collecting them.

The tension between constitutional liberalism and democracy centers on the scope of governmental authority. It is challenging to say how a good outcome can be achieved in anybody's judgment from the current position, and the damage to the concept of democracy will also be damaging to Western democracy's standing in the rest of the world. There are some negative aspects of Iraqi society, including the absence of tolerance, the disrespect for alternative means of expression, and the demand for strict conformity, which are common in the Arab world.

However, some people may not feel energized after eating salads or plant-based diets because they are not eating enough of the right nutrients or are not consuming enough calories. They may also be consuming plant-based diets that are not balanced, for example, lacking in iron or vitamin B12. On the other hand, eating meats, cheeses, and fats may make some people feel better because of the quality of the meat they are eating, and they may be consuming healthier fats like omega-3s and conjugated linoleic acid. However, it is important to note that eating high-quality meat should be done in moderation and should not be the main meal, but rather a condiment.",

In Panama, the monthly fee for public schools ranges from $200 for each child for 10 months, but the public school system there does not have a good reputation. The Catholic school system in Australia has individual schools that have become part of larger regions to efficiently direct and use the new funding.

In contrast, Comcast negotiates directly with content providers to carry their content, and they can charge Netflix a lot of money to make sure its streams flow smoothly over the last mile that the ISP controls. Furthermore, Hulu charges $7.99/month for limited commercials and $11.99/month for commercial-free content, which shows that the difference between $8 and $12 is huge in terms of percentage. Therefore, it is not surprising that Netflix can offer a wide range of content with no commercials for $12/month while Comcast charges more than $50/month for limited content that is 1/3 advertisements.",

The front brake is larger in diameter and more powerful than the rear brake. The front brake tends to be more effective than the rear brake because almost all the force is released from the rear wheels and hurled towards the front of the car, which can cause the wheels to lock suddenly and the car will be sent into an uncontrollable skid.

They have lived in the land for thousands of years and have Aboriginal rights and title on the land they traditionally used and occupied. Comprehensive land claim agreements, also known as modern day treaties, are agreements that exchange undefined Aboriginal rights for defined treaty rights, and title to the land. Aboriginal land claims generally fall into two categories: comprehensive land claims, which are based on Aboriginal title, and specific land claims, which generally include allegations of non-fulfillment of terms under a treaty or improper dealing with reserves as regulated by the Indian Act. Aboriginal land claims are a major issue for the real estate industry, particularly as development spreads beyond the well-established urban centres of the country, where opportunities for development are increasingly scarce.",

                "output": "Due to oceanic currents, much of the trash is carried to areas where the currents meet. These collections of trash have recently been referred to as marine trash islands. When trash is discarded into the ocean, it often becomes incorporated into physical ocean features such as currents and gyres. Human waste in the ocean is becoming a problem so large that giant, swirling vortexes of trash now exist in the Pacific Ocean. Trash ends up in the ocean when people litter, when waste is not properly managed and ends up in waterways, or when extreme weather events or natural disasters cause waste to be washed into the ocean. A significant amount of trash and plastic waste end up in the ocean through carelessness, such as littering, and through inadequate waste management and recycling programs in densely populated areas without adequate waste collection or recycling programs. For example, about 80% of the plastic trash that ends up in the ocean comes from land-based activities, specifically ten rivers that run through densely populated areas without adequate waste collection or recycling programs. Moreover, oceanic currents carry much of the trash to areas where the currents meet, often forming marine trash islands. Every year, about 8-million tons of plastic ends up in our oceans, which is equal to five bags filled with plastic going along every foot of coastline in the world. Trash not properly managed and recycled, and non-recyclable items, such as some plastics and gum, also end up in the ocean. The majority of plastic trash that ends up in the ocean, about 80%, comes from land-based activities, specifically ten rivers that run through densely populated areas without adequate waste collection or recycling programs.

                "output": "In logic, quantifiers are used to bind variables in well-formed formulae. Constants are fixed values, variables are placeholders that can take on any value, terms are combinations of constants and variables, and sentences are statements that can be either true or false. A formula with no free variables is a sentence. One can eliminate existential quantifiers by introducing a witness, or more precisely, by adjoining a new constant to the language and replacing the statement. In predicate logic, quantifiers are distinguished from constants, variables, terms, and sentences. Constants are represented by lower-case letters a,..,s, while variables are represented by the letters t, u, v, w, x, y, and z. Any lower-case letter may be followed by any number of prime signs ('), and the result will also be a constant or variable. Skolemization is a process in which functions, called Skolem functions or Skolem constants, are used to eliminate existential quantifiers from a sentence, resulting in a universally quantified sentence. This process is most appropriate in the CNF conversion procedure. In logic, sentences are statements that can be either true or false. Ground instances are simply versions of a sentence where all variables have been substituted so that there are no variables left. In logic, constants and constant terms refer to specific objects in an interpretation, while non-constant terms can still have truth values. Only constant terms actually refer to some specific object in an interpretation. But closed sentences which use nonconstant terms still have truth values. In applying the truth definitions for quantifiers, we form substitution instances, substituting names for variables within function symbols as well as elsewhere. Depending on the types of quantifiable variables, predicate calculi of different orders are distinguished.",

It is rare to find natural pearls in the market because only 5% of pearls found in mollusks with two shells like an oyster are natural. Before the 1890s, when we learned how to grow pearls, all pearls were what we now call natural, which means that they were found in an oyster picked from the wild. Even though pearl farmers know the black-lipped oyster is essential to the cultivation of Tahitian black pearls, black pearls are still quite rare compared to white pearls. Pearls are very rare because many hundreds of pearl oysters or mussels must be gathered and opened, and thus killed, to find even one wild pearl; for many centuries, this was the only way pearls were obtained, and why pearls fetched such extraordinary prices in the past.",

Therefore, the effect of alcohol on dopamine levels is not clear-cut and the effect could be both increasing and decreasing depending on the situation. According to, alcohol can increase dopamine levels in the short term, but in the long term it can lead to decreased dopamine levels. The unnatural spikes in dopamine raise the pleasure threshold, meaning that activities that were once reinforcing or pleasurable no longer even register. To complicate matters, our brains do not tolerate unnatural amounts of dopamine, so the brain actually decreases the dopamine available via decreased synthesis, decreased receptor sites and increased normal baseline.",

The process of compression is done in a compressed format to save space. The file size gets reduced through the use of algorithms that encode the data in a more efficient way. Compressing data into ZIP archives provides interoperability between platforms and considerable savings in DASD and bandwidth. If the file size is much lower, then the data is compressible. The purpose of data compression is simply to reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent or stored. However, if the data is raw audio, compression doesn't work well. MP3 gets its compression from psychoacoustics, which models human auditory perception to remove data that can't be perceived. All file systems and disks have built-in compression technologies such as zip and b-zip. PKZIP compresses files up to 95%, making the data take up less disk space. End",

                "output": "Watermelon is related to black people because of the stereotype that black people like watermelons, which traces back to slavery and Africa in general. Watermelon was also one of the first products that newly freed African Americans were able to make money from after the Civil War, so it became a symbol of freedom for the black community. The stereotype that black people like watermelon is an absurd generalization that is often made when a black person is eating watermelon, but not when a white person is eating it. The stereotype that black people like fried chicken and watermelon is a common one that is often perpetuated in racist representations associated with African-Americans and watermelons. End.",

In some cases, the policies proposed by the government may not align with the interests of the majority of the people, leading to a widening gap between the will of the people and the interests of those in charge.

                "output": "Fast food chains get away with paying staff such a low wage because of the industry's low profit margins, which rely on low labor costs to maintain profitability. Massive fast food chains like McDonald's and Burger King are able to get away with paying their staff such a low wage because it is only the legally-required minimum wage. Fast food workers are paid low wages, which employers can reduce by cutting hours to save costs. This makes it difficult for workers to afford basic necessities like rent, food, and medicine. Fast food chains employ staff at minimum wage, which helps them produce high-carb, fat-laden, 'fast food'. Fast food chains are able to get away with paying staff such a low wage because they have traditionally offered low-cost menu items, such as the dollar menu or value menu. Low-wage fast food workers are far more likely to need help from government programs like food stamps and subsidized housing -- which, themselves, are a further drag on taxpayers. However, labor organizers are putting pressure on fast-food chains to raise worker pay.",

The main rotor works like long narrow wings, generating lift as they spin rapidly through the air. The propellers are powered by a gas turbine engine which provides enough force to lift the weight of the helicopter and its occupants. Each blade of the main rotor produces an equal share of the lifting force. The collective changes the pitch of the main rotor blades giving the helicopter the required lift. A helicopter lifts itself off the ground by rotating the main top rotor (propeller) at high speed. This large rotating propeller 'pushes' air downward, and (by Newton's third law) creates an opposing upward force which lifts the helicopter up and off the ground. Therefore, it makes sense that the propellers have enough lift to lift a helicopter.",

Many stations would opt to simply show reruns of old Saturday morning cartoons instead of producing their own local children's shows. In recent years, networks have stopped showing Saturday morning cartoons because children now have access to cartoons and other shows on a variety of platforms, such as cable channels, streaming services, and online.

The freezing temperatures of the freezer were damaging the bulbs, which is why freezer lights are much less common than fridge lights. The light would likely end up concealed by the frozen items, making it a hassle to move around items just to get to the light.",

Repeated scooping and refreezing can cause ice crystals to form, making ice cream harder to scoop and less pleasurable to eat. The hardness of ice cream can be affected by the temperature of the freezer and the amount of air whipped into the ice cream, which can cause it to freeze harder than it would in a dedicated ice cream freezer. When ice cream is repeatedly melted and refrozen, ice crystals form, which can make it harder to scoop and less pleasurable to eat.

Chess960 is a variant that allows players to choose how to set up their pieces in the first two rows at the start, with the restriction that the pieces are symmetrical to the opponent's pieces.

                "output": "The term \"literally\" is often used in casual conversation to describe circumstances or events that cannot be meant literally. This is because the word \"literally\" means exactly, in a strict sense, or to the letter, while \"figuratively\" means in a metaphorical sense, not in a real sense but in a way that is expressed through figures of speech. There has been a debate going on for decades whether it is possible to use \u201cliterally\u201d in the sense of \u201cfiguratively\u201d. Language purists claim that such usage is \u201csimply wrong\u201d because the speaker died only figuratively, not literally. To be honest, the whole debate is rather silly. Figurative language is inescapable and refers to the use and application of words in English to mean something else as opposed to the literal meaning. The use of figurative language is of great importance in the world today because of the increasing readership across the globe which is made possible by the advancement in print and online media. In language, figurative language is inescapable. According to Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language, in figurative language \"figures of speech such as metaphors and similes freely occur...they are\". Figurative language is used to create a more vivid and descriptive picture of the speaker's message. It is inescapable and is used to express emotions and ideas that cannot be expressed through literal language. In contrast, literal language refers to the use of language in its exact and precise meaning. Although figurative language and literal language are different, they are both important in conveying a message.",

The Australian Dollar is part of the Crown Currencies, which is a universal term for the currencies of the current and former British commonwealth, including the British Sterling Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Australian Dollar and the New Zealand Kiwi. As a part of the British Commonwealth, Australia was influenced by the British pound system, and the word dollar was already in common use in the colonies. The Australian dollar used to be called a shilling, which was based on the old British sterling system because Australia is a part of the British Commonwealth. Australia used to use the pound sterling as its national currency until 1966 when they decided that it was time to separate further from Britain. The Prime Minister at the time, Sir Robert Menzies, proposed calling the new currency the \"royal\", but a focus group determined that the name was not popular. Therefore, Australia uses a currency called the \"dollar\" due to focus testing.",

                "output": "The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning a stretch of water called the Golden Gate Straight between San Francisco and Marin County. It was built as a suspension bridge with two large towers standing nearly 746 feet above the water and two main cables that string the bridge. The central road or path of a bridge is lowered into place using cranes or rolled across the expanse using cantilevers after the supporting structures have been placed. A cable-stayed bridge is another type of bridge that can be built over water. A cable-stayed bridge can have a longer span than a suspension bridge, so its structure between the supports and the shore could be simpler. Building the towers nearer to the shore, where the waterbed is more shallow, would help alleviate one of the main problems when the Golden Gate Bridge was constructed the first time around: It's very difficult and expensive to work on the tower foundations in deep water with strong currents.",

Miners invest huge sums of money to buy specific hardware that occupies much more space than a normal PC and tries to solve the equation as quickly as possible. Additionally, miners try to find a place where electricity is less expensive because it also has a price. Mining farms for cryptocurrency require a lot of electricity and computers, which is needed to create new crypto. The amount of electricity used for mining crypto is almost as much as a small nation needs. Mining centers generate a total value added of about $80,000 per megawatt compared to nearly $250,000 per megawatt for a small center. Crypto mining chips have certainly gotten more efficient each year, but not to the point that they sufficiently push back against any increased electricity use.",

Lower oil prices boost GDP and consumer spending but lower overall inflation pretty dramatically, which is seen as evidence that people are saying low oil prices will boost the US economy. There is evidence to suggest that the low oil prices could stimulate the US economy through increased spending and investment. However, there has been little evidence that falling oil costs have had a positive effect on the economy. The economic reality shows a strong correlation between the price of oil and the financial growth of a country, with low prices of crude oil often synonymous of a slowing down in the economy. People are saying that low oil prices will boost the US economy because with continued low unemployment in the US and cheap gas, Americans may eventually start spending like people with jobs and extra cash should spend. When the economy is bad, people generally drive less, which will keep gas prices down. The evidence for this is that oil prices are low, hovering around $51 per barrel, and have followed the stock market downward this month.",

The federal form for voter registration doesn't ask if the registrants are U.S. citizens, and the people collecting voter registrations are not allowed to ask if they are citizens or seek proof. This means that illegal residents can register to vote without disclosing their citizenship status, and the Democrat Party is benefiting from this by trying to ensure that these illegal residents vote Democrat. The number of forms submitted by each party can indicate the level of support and potential voter turnout for each party. Democratic bills to ease voting access, such as automatic voter registration, have been killed in Republican-controlled committees. The Republican/Democrat on voter registration forms matter because interest groups are working to register Democrat voters. If the alleged wholesale disenfranchisement of black voters was happening, it would be Democrats, not Republicans to blame.

The protesters want a resolution to the economic crisis, an end to the austerity measures, and a restoration of their political voice. The government does have other choices, but they have chosen to follow the austerity path that has been imposed on them by the European Union.

                "output": "The front brake is more effective than the rear brake because it delivers the lion's share of the stopping power. This is because most of the weight of the bike or car is transferred to the front while braking, limiting the amount of traction the rear tire has and thus the ability of the rear brake to affect the speed. The front wheels are more rugged and there is more vertical force on the front axle than on the rear when the automobile brakes. The rear brake is designed to assist in slowing or stopping the bike. However, applying both brakes too aggressively can cause the brakes to lock, leading to a chance of crashing. Novice or returning riders should learn how to brake properly using primarily the front brake. It is also important to note that the brakes on front wheels are deliberately more powerful than those on the back wheels because almost all the force is released from the rear wheels and hurled towards the front of the car when it is necessary to brake heavily. Proper use of the front brake lever is recommended to stop a bike. Since the front brake is more effective than the rear brake, it is better at stopping a bike, but it can cause a crash or an accident if not done properly.",

Electricity is directed to these outer magnets in sequence, generating an alternating current. The force generated between the outer magnets causes the central magnet to move, which then drives the wheels and creates movement. The movement of the wheels creates a magnet that is surrounded by outer magnets arranged in a circle. Electricity is generated and directed to these outer magnets in sequence, generating an alternating current. This movement creates a voltage. This process is similar to the process of wind turbines, where the kinetic energy created from the movement of the blades is transferred into a generator where it converts to electricity. Movement from a moving wheel creates electricity through a similar process of electromagnetic induction, discovered by Michael Faraday in the 1830s. Faraday discovered that moving an electrical conductor, like a wire containing electric charges, in a magnetic field could induce the flow of electric charges. The movement of the wheels creates a magnet that is surrounded by outer magnets arranged in a circle.

Venture capitalists invest in such start-ups with the hope of making a profit in a few years. Firms like Snapchat and Uber are valued highly despite not making a profit because they have the potential to grow and make a profit in the future. Snapchat is said to be seeking funding at a $19 billion valuation, while Uber is estimated to be valued at about $40 billion. However, some investors are starting to send a message to these unicorns that they need to start producing profits soon, or they can expect their valuation to be slashed.",

The FDA warns against consuming raw batter of any kind because it could make a person sick, citing raw flour as the culprit for a potential E. coli outbreak. While eggs can also be contaminated with salmonella bacteria, anyone making cookies can reduce this risk by using pasteurized egg products. Although most people eat cookie dough and are fine, it is better to skip raw cookie dough because ingredients in the dough could potentially harbor pathogens. Cookie Dough Bites are okay because the egg used is usually pasteurized, but flour, nuts, and chocolate have also been linked to Salmonella outbreaks.",

                "output": "Due to oceanic currents, much of the trash is carried to areas where the currents meet, forming collections of trash referred to as marine trash islands. When trash is discarded into the ocean, it often becomes incorporated into physical ocean features such as currents and gyres. Human waste in the ocean is becoming a problem so large that giant, swirling vortexes of trash now exist in the Pacific Ocean, commonly called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Every year, about 8-million tons of plastic end up in our oceans, which is equal to five bags filled with plastic going along every foot of coastline in the world. While ships throwing their trash overboard accounts for only 20% of the problem, the other 80% comes from land-based activities. Ninety percent of all plastic trash that ends up in the oceans gets there by ten rivers that carry it there, all of which run through densely populated areas that don't have adequate waste collection or recycling programs. Through sorting activities and water demonstrations, students can learn how trash and plastics travel through the environment, and end up in the ocean.",

Constants and variables are used to create terms, which are built by combining constants, variables, and operators. A term can be used to create an atomic formula, which is a formula that contains no logical connectives. A sentence is a formula with no free variables. In addition to constants, variables, and terms, logic also uses quantifiers to bind variables. There are two types of quantifiers: existential and universal. An existential quantifier is used to assert the existence of an object that satisfies a given property, while a universal quantifier is used to assert that a property holds for all objects in a given domain.",

A natural pearl forms when an irritant gets inside the oyster's shell, and to protect itself from the irritant, the oyster secretes a substance called nacre to surround the irritant. Over the years, the nacre layers build up to form a genuine pearl, composed entirely of nacre without human intervention of any kind. Nowadays, most pearls are cultured pearls, meaning that an irritant is implanted within the oyster to mimic the natural process in which a pearl is formed.",

This is called tinnitus, which is the hearing of sound when no external sound is present. Tinnitus can occur due to different factors such as hearing loss, diabetes, thyroid disorders, or multiple sclerosis. Hearing loss often affects quicker vibration sound waves first which results in the inability to hear sounds at a higher frequency. Tinnitus does not cause hearing loss, nor does hearing loss cause tinnitus, but they are associated with one another.",

Tea brewed in the sun can have a lovely gentle flavor, and once in the fridge with lots of ice cubes, it can be a very refreshing drink on a hot day. The temperature of the water used to make tea can also affect how long it stays hot, as hotter water can make tea taste bitter. Drinking hot tea on a hot day might actually help cool you down, as it can help you sweat more efficiently. However, it is important to note that drinking very hot tea can be bad for you, as it can increase your risk of esophageal cancer.",

Nevertheless, the TRAPPIST-1 planets may have too much water to support life. The presence of water is often considered as a way to start life, since life on Earth is composed mostly of water and requires it to live.

The size differential between the PC and Mac ecosystems makes it more lucrative to develop viruses that target Windows. The main reason why Macs seem to be more immune to viruses than PCs is that there are millions more PCs out there, so hackers focus on Windows-based attacks. With a PC, you need to make sure your security software is up to date, which can get tricky with all the programs out there and versions of Windows, and hackers know this. There have been viruses specifically designed for Macs, and that still can happen, but if you keep your anti-spam software up to date and be a smart computer user, you can avoid viruses.

To account for this discrepancy, airlines opt for a more profitable strategy by overbooking flights. This way, airlines can sell more tickets than they have seats, which is advantageous for them as it is always a loss for the airlines every time a flight takes off with empty seats. If there are more passengers than the available seats, the airline may offer alternative flights with some form of additional compensation in order to entice certain passengers to give up their seat. If no one is willing, the airline is forced to deny boarding to some passengers. It is important to note that airlines are allowed to overbook flights because it is unlikely that all passengers will show up for the flight.",

Additionally, miners try to find a place where electricity is less expensive, as electricity is a significant cost of mining. Crypto mining chips have become more efficient each year, but not to the point that they sufficiently push back against any increased electricity use. While some have expressed concern about the amount of energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining, others argue that the industry is highly flexible in where it can deploy and is still in a developmental stage. It is also important to note that cryptocurrency mining is labor-intensive and mainly uses equipment manufactured outside of the US.",

Warrick, a male Ewok scout and warrior, devised plans for defeating the Imperial forces despite the disparity in technology and firepower between the Ewoks and the Imperial forces.

Low fuel prices can help boost economic growth, but two factors behind the oil-price drop - a weaker global economy and a stronger dollar - could hurt the U.S. economy by reducing exports, employment, and spending.

Voter registration fraud does happen, but it is important to note that voter registration forms are in charge of vetting problem ballots, not the groups collecting them.

The concept of a sovereign citizen is related to the social contract theory, in which the citizens agree to give up some of their rights in exchange for protection from the government. One of the consequences of a breach of the social contract is that citizens are released from their obligation to obey the commands of the sovereign or are entitled to engage in revolution. In the United States, the problem arises when the government attempts to enforce the law against individuals who believe that they are not bound by the law because they are sovereign citizens. As a result, law enforcement officers are often not prepared to deal with sovereign citizens, and this can lead to confrontations.",

The tension between constitutional liberalism and democracy centers on the scope of governmental authority. It is challenging to say how a good outcome can be achieved in anybody's judgment from the current position, and the damage to the concept of democracy will also be damaging to Western democracy's standing in the rest of the world. There are some negative aspects of Iraqi society, including the absence of tolerance, the disrespect for alternative means of expression, and the demand for strict conformity, which are common in the Arab world. Tolerance cannot stand on its own, and a persuasive reason is needed to be tolerant of people who are different from oneself and people who one finds objectionable.",

They may also be consuming plant-based diets that are not balanced, for example, lacking in iron or vitamin B12. On the other hand, eating meats, cheeses, and fats may make some people feel better because of the quality of the meat they are eating, and they may be consuming healthier fats like omega-3s and conjugated linoleic acid.

The Catholic school system in Australia has individual schools that have become part of larger regions to efficiently direct and use the new funding.

Comcast, on the other hand, negotiates directly with content providers like HBO to carry their content. Comcast charges for limited content with advertisements because they are a cable provider and have to pay for cable or satellite services to provide content. Netflix's increasing position in the market for online video has fueled a dispute between Level 3 Communications and Comcast. Hulu offers a commercial-free subscription for $11.99.

                "output": "In cars and motorcycles, the front brake tends to be more effective and provides more stopping power than the rear brake. This is because when a vehicle brakes, there is more vertical force on the front axle than on the rear axle due to the force of friction of the roadway on the tires, which produces a clockwise torque about the car's center of gravity. In motorcycles, the front disc brake and calipers are larger in diameter and more powerful than the rear ones. In cars, the brakes on the front wheels are deliberately more powerful than those on back wheels to prevent the rear brakes from causing the wheels to lock suddenly and the car from being sent into an uncontrollable skid.",

They have lived in the land for thousands of years and have Aboriginal rights and title on the land they traditionally used and occupied. Comprehensive land claim agreements, also known as modern day treaties, are agreements that exchange undefined Aboriginal rights for defined treaty rights, and title to the land. Aboriginal land claims generally fall into two categories: comprehensive land claims, which are based on Aboriginal title, and specific land claims, which generally include allegations of non-fulfillment of terms under a treaty or improper dealing with reserves as regulated by the Indian Act. Aboriginal land claims are a major issue for the real estate industry, particularly as development spreads beyond the well-established urban centres of the country, where opportunities for development are increasingly scarce.",

This experience can be compared to the \"flow state\" experienced by athletes and others, where the individual is fully engaged in the activity, and time seems to fly by.

                "output": "Witnessing awkward situations can cause discomfort and embarrassment, which can make the person feel bad. Some research suggests that people who are empathetic and have a strong sense of social awareness may be more likely to feel bad when they witness awkward situations. It is thought that people who are high in empathy may be more likely to take on the perspective of others and feel their emotions, which can intensify their own feelings of discomfort or embarrassment. Additionally, some people may feel bad when they witness awkward situations because they feel a sense of obligation to alleviate the discom",

                "output": "In order for a single sound wave to communicate two or more sounds of different volumes, the sounds must be out of phase. When two absolutely identical waves are mixed, the amplitude of the waves is summed. The volume of a sound depends directly on the amplitude of a wave. If the amplitude of one wave is decreased, the sound will become softer. The speed of a wave is most dependent upon the properties of the medium it is traveling through, not the properties of the wave itself. Sound travels much faster through water than it does through air.",
